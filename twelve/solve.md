break apart anything thats separated by dots.


i.e. 
???.### 1,1,3
becomes 2 length 3 blocks. 
block 1 has 3 options. block 2 has zero options
remove any possible equals. it has to be that one.
??? 1,1 this goes in twice


?#?#?#?#?#?#?#? 1,3,1,6
1 block. 

0 has to be a .
1 has to be a .
.#.#?#?#?#? 3,1,6

next question mark must be a #
and the one after must be a .
.#.###.#.#? 

break down into groups
??? ###
iterate on the list count until it busts
1,1 for ???. can go in once. 
no room in ###. done.

find all the groups of ###
